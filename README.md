# Fine-tuning Llama2 7B Chat Model Locally
This repository demonstrates fine-tuning an Large Language Model (LLM) on Google Colab, or your local system with good hardware available.

# Here's an overview üåü

**Why fine-tune an LLM?**

Fine-tuning is useful when you have a specific domain of data and want the LLM to perform well on that domain. For example, you can fine-tune a large language model on a dataset of medical text to create a medical chatbot. 

**When to fine-tune vs. RAG**

RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generation) is a different approach to combining an LLM with a database. RAG is better suited for situations where the data is constantly changing, whereas fine-tuning is better for static datasets. 

**Steps to fine-tune Llama 2**

* Install the required libraries: accelerate, transformers, bitsandbytes, and huggingface_hub 
* Set up the model and dataset: Specify the name of the pre-trained model (Llama2 in this case) and the dataset you want to fine-tune it on. The dataset should be formatted in a specific way, with prompts and answers.
* Configure the training parameters: This includes specifying the name of the fine-tuned model, the number of training epochs, the batch size, and other hyperparameters. 
* Train the model: This can take several minutes or hours depending on the size of the dataset and the hardware you are using. 
* Save and evaluate the model: Once the training is complete, you can save the fine-tuned model and evaluate its performance on a held-out test set.
* Using the Fine-Tuned Model: The fine-tuned model can be used for various tasks depending on your specific domain. You can use the accelerate library to load the model and generate text or answer questions based on your prompts.

# Advantages üìà
**Improved Performance on Specific Domains**

Fine-tuning allows Llama2 to specialize in your chosen domain by learning from your custom dataset. This can lead to more accurate and relevant outputs when you use the model for tasks related to that domain.

**Cost-Effective**
Google Colab offers free computing resources with limitations. This makes it a viable option for experimenting with fine-tuning without significant upfront costs. If you have good hardware available, you can use Jupyter Notbook for this task as well.

**Accessibility**

Anyone with a Google account can access Colab, making this approach approachable for individuals and smaller teams who might not have access to dedicated computing resources.

**Customization**

Fine-tuning allows you to tailor Llama2 to your specific needs by using your own dataset and adjusting training parameters.


# Lessons üìù

**Understanding Requirements**

It's crucial to have a well-formatted dataset with prompts and answers relevant to your domain for effective fine-tuning.

**Hardware Limitations**

Colab offers free resources with limitations. The training speed and dataset size might be restricted compared to dedicated computing environments. Patience is needed for training larger datasets.

**Configurability**

This approach requires some technical expertise in Python and familiarity with libraries like accelerate and transformers to configure the training process and utilize the fine-tuned model.

**Evaluation**

While the approach provides a basic guide, incorporating model evaluation metrics into the process would be beneficial to assess the effectiveness of the fine-tuning on your specific task.


**Overall, fine-tuning Llama2 locally offers a cost-effective and accessible way to improve the model's performance on your specific domain. However, it's important to be aware of the hardware limitations and the need for some technical and domain expertise.**
